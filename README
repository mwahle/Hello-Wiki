Experimenting with new random indexing methods and information retrieval
methods, the Wikipedia corpus turned out to be an intuitive base for
experiments. But I couldn't really find a tool that would extract the textual
information (stripped of all wiki markup) from the Wikipedia articles. So I
wrote a Java program, intended to be used as a library, to do this job.


Right now, there are two Java classes:
* Extractor.java, which does the actual job of loading and parsing the dump
  file and extracting the articles
* MakeLuceneIndex.java, which uses the Extractor to walk through the complete
  dump file and puts the contents into a Lucene index


The regular expressions that strip the wiki markup code are not exactly perfect
but were good enough for my purposes. I'm inviting anybody to use this project
and I'll happily include any improvements. Special thanks go to rvedam for
contributing the build.xml and getting me started on Java development.



Dependencies:

Currently, this project depends on the following libraries:
* Apache Lucene (currently version 6.6.0). You can download the Lucene library at
  http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/java/


Compilation Instructions (changed from MWahle's original instructions):

- Run "mvn clean install" in the root directory and inform dwiddows if there are problems.
